## üí° The Problem: Moving from Intention to Action

Many companies genuinely want to support their employees' mental health, but they often lack the data-driven tools to understand their unique environment. This leads to generic, one-size-fits-all solutions that are often ineffective. The key challenge is bridging the gap between the *desire* to help and the *ability* to provide targeted, impactful support.

## ‚ú® Our Solution: The AI Wellness Hub

Our Hub tackles this problem with a two-pronged, AI-powered approach:

### 1. üìà The Workplace Wellness Advisor
A sophisticated diagnostic tool designed for managers and HR leaders. It provides a multi-faceted analysis of the workplace environment, turning raw data into clear, actionable strategy.

**Key Features:**
*   **Predictive Analysis:** Forecasts the likelihood of employees seeking mental health treatment using a fine-tuned XGBoost model.
*   **Wellness Report Card:** Scores the workplace on the crucial dimensions of "Support Structures" and "Open Culture."
*   **AI Explainability (SHAP):** Moves beyond a "black box" AI by using SHAP to reveal the exact factors driving the prediction, building trust and providing deep insights.
*   **Generative AI Companion (Gemini):** A Google Gemini-powered advisor provides a detailed, empathetic interpretation of the results with actionable recommendations.
*   **AI Action Kit:** Instantly generates draft emails and meeting agendas to help managers implement the AI's advice.
*   **Downloadable PDF Report:** Creates a professional, shareable PDF summary of the complete analysis for stakeholder meetings.

### 2. üí¨ The Mental Healthcare Chatbot
A safe and anonymous informational resource for everyone. This chatbot uses Google Gemini to provide reliable, general information about mental healthcare topics. It is strictly programmed with safety protocols to **not** give medical advice and to **immediately provide crisis hotline numbers** if a user appears to be in distress.

## üöÄ The Development Journey & Technical Deep Dive

Our process was a real-world journey of iterative development and intelligent problem-solving.

1.  **Initial Model (V1):** We began by training several models on the [OSMI Mental Health in Tech Survey dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey).
2.  **The Critical Insight (V2):** We built a prototype and discovered a critical flaw‚Äîthe model was "lazy," relying on non-actionable features like `Age` and `family_history`. While statistically accurate, it was not practically useful as an advisor.
3.  **The Strategic Pivot (V3):** We re-engineered our entire approach, creating a focused "Advisor Model" by intentionally removing non-actionable features. This forced the AI to learn the more subtle patterns within workplace policies, making the tool genuinely responsive.
4.  **Advanced Data Techniques (V4):** To enhance our focused model, we implemented `IterativeImputer` to intelligently handle missing data and `SMOTE` to synthetically augment our training set, leading to a more robust final model.
5.  **The Complete Application (V5):** We built the final multi-page application, integrating all advanced features like SHAP, Gemini AI, PDF reports, and the informational chatbot.
